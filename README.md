## Introduction 

Making  <b>Smart Garage system </b> IoT device using<b> NodeMCU </b>which can be opened or closed using Google Assistant only when you are near your Garage.

<b>IoT</b> will use<b> MQTT </b>protocol (Similar to Client Server communication protocol ) for communicating with server.
It is a light message transfer protocol used for communication among various IoT devices we see is the Market.

Those who don't know much about Mqtt Protocol can refer the PDF uploaded above to get basic insight of ,how the Protocol
works.

We will use Adafruit io as our Broker in Mqtt system ,which provides free Mqtt cloud based Broker Service and NodeMCU based
IoT device as client.

Further we will build Applets using IFTTT to Make Google Assistant to control our IoT device.

## Configuring Arduino IDE for ESP8266 based Dev Boards

Initially Arduino IDE dosen't have Addon by default ,so we have to install the Addons for Esp8266 based Boards using Arduino Board Manager.To begin, we’ll need to update the board manager with a custom URL. Open up Arduino, then go to the Preferences 
<b>(File > Preferences)</b>. Then, towards the bottom of the window, copy this URL into the “Additional Board Manager URLs” text box:

<pre> http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json </pre>

Hit OK. Then navigate to the Board Manager by going to <b>Tools > Boards > Boards Manager</b>.There should be a couple new entries in addition to the standard Arduino boards. Look for <b>esp8266</b>. Click on that entry, then select <b>Install</b>.

The board definitions and tools for the ESP8266 Thing include a whole new set of gcc, g++, and other reasonably large, compiled binaries, so it may take a few minutes to download and install (the archived file is ~110MB). Once the installation has completed, an Arduino-blue “INSTALLED” will appear next to the entry.

Now go on <b> Tools > Boards </b> and Scroll down and select <b> NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP 12-E Module) </b> .

## Burning Code On Node MCU

First take above two libraries file provided by vendors itself which are Arduino & Adafruit and put them in the <b>Libraries</b>
folder inside your Arduino folder. 

Open mqtt.ino & put your Router SSID & Password , also put your AIO username & Key into it. Connect your NodeMCU to your computer and go to <b>tools > Port</b> 
and select COM port and compile & load the code to your dev. board

Set Baud Rate of Serial Monitor 115200 for syncing Serial Communication.

Login to your Account go on Applets Create Applets Accordingly Choosing triggers as Alexa & Google Assistant respectively 
and response as Adafruit IO and select Appropriate feeds. Finally Switch on your Applets & you are done
